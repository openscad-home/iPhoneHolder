= iPhoneHolder

A simple iPhoneX holder to be installed in the car.
The iPhoneX I use has a QuadLock cover and the phone has to fit into the holder with the cover.

The design contains a module, which is the solid body of the iPhoneX itself inside the QuadLock cover.
This solid body has protruding parts at the screen, camera and the power adapter.

The holder is a solid box and the iPhoneX body is removed from it using `difference(){}`.

In addition to that the top of the holder is cut off, so that the phone can be put into it from the top.

I use the holder in my Prius glued to board in front of the steering wheel using Gekko Tape.
